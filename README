This is a Tcl extension utilising the libmagic to provide scriptlevel access to
determine the type of a file or buffer.

This package is a freely available open source package.  You can do
virtually anything you like with it, such as modifying it, redistributing
it, and selling it either in whole or in part.  See the file

Building under most UNIX systems is easy, just run the configure script
and then run make. For more information about the build process, see
the tcl/unix/README file in the Tcl src dist. The following minimal
example will install the extension in the /opt/tcl directory.

	$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/tcl
	$ make
	$ make install
